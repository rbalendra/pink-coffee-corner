# QUESTIONS TO ASK


###### 1) Need a bit more clarification on the Flex box order when there is a massive gap between cards as the flow is broken. Placeholder box not working properly when the re-sized

###### 3) Weird behaviour of browser always scrolling down to reviews section when refreshed or code is updated live. Is it because I've added smooth scrolling behaviour for the whole html file?

- [x] /partials: _normalize,_variables,_colors, _typography
